# ransomware
This is python script that emulates ransomware.

It uses the fernet cryptography library to encrypt and decrypt files.

It does not encrypt directories.

Only files in the same directory as the script are encrypted so make sure there are no important files in the target directory.

The decryption key generated is sent to the attacker's email which you can specify in the code 

I have only tested the script in a linux environment but i'll test it on windows soon and give an update.



HAVE FUN :)
