# ransomware
This is python script that emulates ransomware.

It uses the fernet cryptography library to encrypt and decrypt files.

It does not encrypt directories.

Only files in the same directory as the script are encrypted.

I have only tested the script in a linux environment but i'll test it on windows soon and give an update.

THE DECRYPT KEY IS "letMeIn".

HAVE FUN :)
